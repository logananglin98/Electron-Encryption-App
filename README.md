# Electron Encryption

## Warning: DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANY GENUINE ENCRYPTION NEEDS!

## Description

This was a final project for a computer security class I took during the Fall 2024 semester at Berea College. The initial repository was a private repository for the class. Because of this, I had to create a new repository and copy the original repository's contents. [OriginalClassProjectReadme.md](OriginalClassProjectREADME.md) contains the original readme information pertinent to this project. [OldCommitHistory.txt](OldCommitHistory.txt) contains the commit log for the original repository.

# CSC 493: R03: Update Requirements and Software Development<sup>1</sup>

## Overview
You created a file called <code>requirements.md</code> where you will have your Preliminary Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and hopefully included a lot of information to help you move forward with initial implemtation. Well, now is the time!

## Documentation

You have two written tasks to complete before next time. First, update the <code>README.md</code> file with any changes you have made in your project. and include links to your concept and requirements files. To add the links, encapsulate the text to be seen with square brackets and then immediately follow that with parenthesis with RELATIVE links that consists of just the filename.

<code>README.md</code>
- Project name
- Project Concept (linked to <code>concept.md</code>)
- Vision<br> Remember that the paragraph of your vision is here.
- Scope<br> Remember that the paragraph of your scope is here.- Vision
- Prerequisites
- **Requirements (linked to <code>requirements.md</code>)**
- Built With
- Author name
- Acknowledgments

Secondly, you are to finalize the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) in <code>requirements.md</code>. This step includes breaking down still complex components into individual doable pieces and then prioritizing the list to put the most important core components at the top. 

<code>requirements.md</code>

        - **Number**: Requirement 1 [complete minus decrypt.html]
  - **Statement**: Create a basic html/css layout for the app with minimal design that will accomodate the functionality of the app.
  - **Evaluation Method**: There will be login, account creation, and encryption/decryption html files linked to css file(s).
  - **Dependency**: none
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

        - **Number**: Requirement 2 [complete]
  - **Statement**: Create sripts that handle logging in and creating accounts. These accounts will be linked to a css file that handles login information.
  - **Evaluation Method**: User can use the html pages to create an account and login. These html pages will be linked to the scripts.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 1
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

        - **Number**: Requirement 3 [complete]
  - **Statement**: Add a function to the script for account creation that generates a random key and adds it to the login information.
  - **Evaluation Method**: Random key is in the third column of the csv after an account is created.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 2
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

          - **Number**: Requirement 4 [complete]
  - **Statement**: Add ability to upload files to be encrypted.
  - **Evaluation Method**: User can click a button on the page that will bring up a file manager window for them to select the file. Running the code in this state will bring up the incomplete encryption script because it is linked to the encryption html page.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 1
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

          - **Number**: Requirement 5
  - **Statement**: Complete encryption script.
  - **Evaluation Method**: After uploading the file, the file will be passed to the encryption script which will encrypt the file and will task the user to download the encrypted version of the file.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 4
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

          - **Number**: Requirement 6
  - **Statement**: Add ability to upload files to be decrypted.
  - **Evaluation Method**: User can click a button on the page that will bring up a file manager window for them to select the file. Running the code in this state will bring up the incomplete decryption script because it is linked to the encryption html page.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 1
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

          - **Number**: Requirement 7
  - **Statement**: Complete Decryption file.
  - **Evaluation Method**: After uploading the file and after processing the file, the encryption script will encrypt the file and will task the user to download the encrypted version of the file. The decryption script will use the key saved in the csv to decrypt the file.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 6
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

          - **Number**: "Requirement" 8
  - **Statement**: Add more than 1 encryption algorithm.
  - **Evaluation Method**: User will have the option to encrypt the input file with one or more encryption algorithms from a list.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 1 through 7
  - **Priority**: If time permits.
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

          - **Number**: "Requirement" 9
  - **Statement**: Create custom encryption
  - **Evaluation Method**: One of the encryption algorithms is a "homemade" algorithm unique to this app.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 1 through 8
  - **Priority**: If time permits.
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

          - **Number**: "Requirement" 10
  - **Statement**: Enhance CSS so the app looks sleek, modern, and intuitive.
  - **Evaluation Method**: I and others will like the way the app looks.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 1 through 7
  - **Priority**: If time permits.
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

            - **Number**: "Requirement" 11
  - **Statement**: Add "drag and drop" box to encryption and decryption html pages.
  - **Evaluation Method**: User can opt to drag the file they want to encrypt or decrypt into a box that will accomplish what the upload button does without opening a file manager.
  - **Dependency**: Requirement 1 through 7
  - **Priority**: If time permits.
  - **Requirement revision history**: (when, what, and why)

## Begin Software development

Once you determine the CORE requirements of your system, you can start seriously thinking about HOW you want to implement them. There is no length requirement for how much software you write before next time.

# To Submit

Commit changes to your repository and be ready to bring them up in the reporting out session. 

Remember to begin implementing the core components of your system for a "proof of concept" prototype!

Zeroes and ones, a symphony in code,
Technology's melody, our constant guide,
Invisible strings, entangled worldwide,
A digital world, where reality erodes.

We connect, yet feel more alone,
Social networks that bind and divide,
Our true selves lost, we try to hide,
As technology's grip turns hearts to stone.

But in this vast digital abyss,
Hope flickers, a small beacon of light,
To reclaim our humanity, we must fight,
To strike a balance, where both worlds coexist.

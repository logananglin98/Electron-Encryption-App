|     Final Commit. Updated CSS so the app looks better. Fixed a major bug I missed that was causing a mismatch between a file and a version of the file afer being encrypted and decrypted. App now works with all file types I have tested except for disk images. Installers for the final version of the app have replaced the previous installers in the Google Drive folder.

|     This commit signifies what I consider to be a complete final project. This may be what I submit for a final grade, however, I may try adding some features depending on how long that will take.
|     
|     As of now, running the app from installing it to encrypting or decrypting a file works as follows:
|     
|     The app can be installed using one of the installers in my 2024FA-CSC450/Individual Work/Final PRoject Installers folder. There is a link to this folder in the README.
|     
|     Once the app is installed and launched, a login screen will appear. There is a default/testing password with the username and password both being 123, however, the an account can be created using a create account link found on the first screen.
|     
|     After logging in, an end user can upload a file to encrypt or click the "decrypt an encrypted file" link to decrypt a file. Most file types work. I have had success with images, sound files, .tar.gz files, executables, and several other file types. Some notable exceptions were 7zip files and .iso image files. Once the uploaded file has been encrypted, the user will be prompted to select a save location using the OS file manager. The original copy of the file IS NOT deleted, so the user will need to delete it themselves if necessary for their needs.
|     
|     An encrypted file can only be decrypted by the same account that encrypted it. Because the login information is handled locally, this also means that the decryption must happen on the same machine using the same install of the app* UNLESS the user navigates to their Electron Encryption appdata folder (roaming for Windows, .config for Linux) and copies .logins.csv to the same folder on another machine with the app installed.
|     *Because the app's appdata is stored in Roaming, it may carry over to other Windows machines using the same Microsoft account, but I haven't tested this.
|     
|     I have tested the functionality of this app on Windows 10 and Pop OS (an Ubuntu-based Linux distro). I have not tested the RHEL installer.

| 
|     The app code is mostly done at this point. I'm running into some issues compiling the code into an app. Making this commit so I can delete my local copy of this repository, re-clone it, and reinstall node_modules and npm.

| 
|     .logins.csv is now stored in the appdata folder or .config folder asssociated with the app. The app is compiling and runs correctly for Debian/Ubuntu-based and RHEL-based Linux distros. Working to add the ability to install the app on Windows and maybe also macos and Arch-based Linux distros as well.

| 
|     User can now log out. I changed the name of logins.csv to .logins.csv so it will be hidden in the appdata folder when it is installed. This is a minor change that may increase security a tiny bit. Added better documentation to create_account.js and login.js. Will do the same for encrypt.js and decrypt.js later. Working on getting a working version of the compiled app.

| 
|     Encryption and decryption scripts are both complete. Will add a way of logging out and will then try to run the app in its compiled form.

|     encrypt.js has been set up to only encrypt files, uses a class instead of purely functions, and may be completely finished. Will work on Decrypt next.

| 
|     Added code to allow any file to be encrypted and decrypted. The script still encrypts and decrypts the code in a single run, but now, the uploaded file is encrypted, and any file type can be used. What still needs to be implemented:  *Separating the scripts and setting up html pages so the user can encrypt OR decrypt a file without doing both at the same time  *Allow user to select where encrypted or decrypted file will be saved using their file manager

| 
|     This is a "working" version of the encrypt and decrypt code. As of now, both the encrypt code and decrypt code are located in the encrypt.js script.  They both encrypt a file called "test_file.txt" instead of a file the user uploads. They both successfully use a global key variable from index.js that is set when the user logs in. The key is derived from the third column in the csv. The initialization vector (iv) is randomly created in the encrypt code every time a file is encrypted, therefore, a file encrypted more than once by the same user will result in different encrypted text. What still needs to be implimented:  *Move decrypt code to decrypt.js  *Allow user to choose between encrypting and decrypting a file with the front end  *Integrating the upload functionality from encrypt.html so it passes the file into encrypt.js so this scipt can encrypt a file the user selects instead of test_file.txt  *The same process proceeding but with the decrypt functionality.  *Both encrypting and decrypting a file will end with the user being promped with a download

| 
|     Account handling, login script, and create account script completed for pre-encryption-implementation stage. These have been completed WITHOUT any encryption functionality implemented. A way of getting a checksum or key will need to be added to create_account.js. Some way of passing the key or checksum to the encrytion and decryption script will need to be implemented.

| 
|     I believe I fixed the issues mentioned before. I'm still working on create_account.js and adding checks for password strength, however, once I finish create_account.js, login.js will be relatively easy to implement.

| 
|     Got much more of the create_account script done, however, I'm getting a weird problem where password_too_short.html is loaded even if; the file password_too_short is deleted, caches are cleaned, dependencies are re-installed, among several other attempts in tandem. I'm going to try deleting EVERYTHING related to this electron app and repo on my PC and clone it again.

|     create_account.js is appending to csv. Need to add code to check csv for if the account already exists and checks the length of the username and password. Also need to check if password and confirm_password are the same
